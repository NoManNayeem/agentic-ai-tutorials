Conclusions\\nThis research discusses the advantages of input–output tables (a\\ntop-down approach) over CBA (a bottom-up approach) for study-\\ning infrastructure dependencies. CBA works best when there is\\nadequate information to calculate a monetary value for all eco-\\nnomic, social, and environmental impacts of an individual infra-\\nstructure project. Input–output tables are most effective for analysing\\nthe economic value when the environmental and social impacts of\\ninfrastructure are clearly distinguished from the economic impact.\\nInput–output tables work better than CBA when the economic'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe LiveCycle PDF Generator', 'creator': 'PTC Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 11.1.4012/W', 'creationdate': '2025-01-09T08:29:24+05:30', 'moddate': '2025-01-09T08:29:25+05:30', 'title': 'IC-ENSU240039 1..13', 'source': 'economics_1.pdf', 'total_pages': 13, 'page': 10, 'page_label': '11'}, page_content='Input–output tables work better than CBA when the economic\\nimpacts of infrastructure are dispersed across many economic sectors\\nor other infrastructures.

      " Learning in Dynamic Bayesian Stackelberg Games refers to the process where a leader and a fully strategic follower interact repeatedly, with the follower's type being unknown. Contrary to some existing results, it has been shown that the leader can improve their utility through learning in repeated play in these settings. The effectiveness of learning in these games has been demonstrated without needing to limit the follower's strategic space. The improvement achieved through learning is not solely due to the leader's ability to commit, nor does learning simply substitute for communication between the leader and the follower. There are algorithms, including a mixed-integer linear program, that can be used to compute the optimal leader policy in these games, as well as heuristic algorithms to approximate the optimal dynamic policy more efficiently.\n",
